Welcome to the E03 - The Lincolnshire Poacher Emulator

"When I was bound apprentice in famous Lincolnshire,
I serv'd my master truly, for nearly seven odd year,
Till I took up to poaching, as you shall quickly hear.
Oh, 'tis my delight on a shining night, in the season of the year."

E03 was a numbers station and was so named after the 2 bar tune taken from an old folk song called 'The Lincolnshire Poacher' - which was played as an interval (or tuning) signal before the main broadcast.

Much and little is known about number stations, as no government has acknowledged their existence or operation. What we think we know about E03 is that at one time it broadcasted from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus and stopped transmissions around July 2008. E03 also had a sister station in the southern hemisphere, E03a, which used the folk song 'Cherry Ripe' as its interval signal and was last reported in December 2009.

This emulator was created as a bit of fun to cast light on the mysterious world of Number Stations.
